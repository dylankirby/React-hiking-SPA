# Get-Out-And-Hike

SPA built using react/webpack leveraging third party API to return hikes close to a user using location data, where they can then select a hike to get more information.

Limited information as is due to the third party API. Thus a custom API will be designed to provide more detailed information about the hikes.

Bootstrapped from Stephen Grider's React-Redux Simple Starter

Not an example of high quality code. Currently being redeveloped
